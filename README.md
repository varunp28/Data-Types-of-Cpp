AIM- To study and implement c++ program structures(data types).
Theory:
Understanding and Comparing Basic Data Types in C++

In C++, basic data types form the foundation of all variable declarations and memory operations. These data types include:

Integer types (int, short, long, long long, and their unsigned variants)

Floating-point types (float, double, long double)

Character type (char)

Boolean type (bool)
Each of these types has specific characteristics in terms of memory size, range, and precision, which can vary based on the system architecture and compiler settings.

Sizes
bool

Size: 1 byte

Represents: true or false
char

Size: 1 byte

Used to store characters (e.g., 'A', 'b', etc.)
signed char

Size: 1 byte

Range: -128 to 127
unsigned char

Size: 1 byte

Range: 0 to 255
short (or short int)

Size: 2 bytes

Range: approximately -32,768 to 32,767
unsigned short

Size: 2 bytes

Range: 0 to 65,535
int

Size: 4 bytes

Range: approximately -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
unsigned int

Size: 4 bytes

Range: 0 to 4,294,967,295
long

Size: 8 bytes on most 64-bit systems (may be 4 bytes on 32-bit)

Range: very large, typically over ±9 quintillion
unsigned long

Size: 8 bytes

Range: 0 to over 18 quintillion
long long

Size: 8 bytes

Guaranteed to be at least 64 bits
float

Size: 4 bytes

Precision: about 6–7 decimal digits
double

Size: 8 bytes

Precision: about 15–16 decimal digits
long double

Size: 8, 12, or 16 bytes (platform/compiler dependent)

Higher precision than double, but not always significantly
